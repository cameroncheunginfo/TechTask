# Victorian Plumbing - Code Review Task

Thank you for taking the time to participate in this technical assessment!

This task is to evaluate some code that is not up to our standards and yet could be seen in the real world.  We’ve designed this task to give you an opportunity to showcase your knowledge and help us understand your approach to evaluating and solving technical challenges. It’s also something we’ll discuss further during the interview if you proceed to that stage.

At Victorian Plumbing, we value clear thinking, problem-solving, and the ability to identify issues early to build robust solutions. This task is your chance to demonstrate how you approach thinking about code.

We’ll use the results of this task as an important part of our decision-making process. While we may consider other factors, this task will be the primary focus in deciding whether to invite you for an interview.

We’re excited to see what you find so good luck!

## Objective

Your task is to perform a code review of a simple solution built using C# and Entity Framework. The solution consists of three API endpoints for managing orders.

## What You Need to Do

1. **Download the code**:
   - The code is available to download from https://github.com/Victorian-Plumbing/OrdersCodeReview.git

2. **Take some time to read the solution thoroughly and feel free to run it**:    
   - Each endpoint works with the example swagger payloads   
   - Play with it, test it and check the details
   - We haven't provided unit tests, this is deliberate (so there is no need to comment on this)
   - Some classes and interfaces contain placeholders or trade offs to meet the needs of setting up the task but they are generally labelled

3. **Write a Code Review**:
   - If you find anything you like then tell us!  We like keeping things constructive
   - Write a document that reports on the code, you may use any format you like
   - Consider general issues in the structure of the code or points of logic
   - If you spot any potential bugs then write up how the bug would occur
   - If you spot anything where you can refer to a resource or documentation then provide a link and show off your sources and knowledge
   - Also consider the resources we've provided in the job description about how we write code

4. **Time Limit**:
   - Please spend no more than a couple of hours on this task.
   - If you get stuck then that's okay, just send us what you've managed to do
   - Do not feel like you have to cover every element of the code, but make sure what you cover is appropriate to your level of experience

### Important Note:

- **Take your time**: There is no rush to complete this task.  
- **Do not let any recruiter pressure you**: We do not require this task to be completed immediately or by a deadline.  However we may end hiring without notice if we fill all of our intended spots.
- If you don’t have time tonight, that’s absolutely fine, another evening is just as good.  
- We understand that you have a life outside of the job hunt, and we respect that.  

We want you to be at your best when completing this task, so please work at a pace that suits you!

We’re looking forward to seeing your thoughts!
